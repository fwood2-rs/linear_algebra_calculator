# LINEAR ALGEBRA HOMEWORK SOLVER

### by Jason Zhou jason.zhou@duke.edu

This python notebook is meant to assist the user in solving linear algebra problems, most likely in a homework context. The contents are based loosely off of the class MATH218 taught at Duke by Professor Joe Rabinoff and Professor Rann Bar-On. It differs from other similar services by offering the following special features:

1. Showing steps

2. Supporting fractions

3. Modular Functions that can be editted

4. Functions can be used in conjunction with each other

5. Detailed documentation and explanation of algorithms

6. Less visual but much more efficient input UI

7. No latency and does not require internet connection

8. Large number of functions all in one place. Majority of functions in an entry level linear algebra class are included

9. Aesthetic LaTex output

What this jupyter notebook is:

1. A homework assistant that automates computation
2. A teaching tool that demonstrates linear algebra algorithms
3. A quick and dirty linear algebra textbook
4. Sympy that shows steps

What this jupyter notebook is not:

1. A replacement for numpy
2. A tool to process large amounts of information in contexts such as machine learning

Notes on known bugs and performance issues:

1. Jupyter notebooks uses MathJax to render latex outputs. When running the entire notebook for the first time it will take a few seconds for latex outputs to render if you see unrendered latex, do not panic it will resolve itself soon.

2. Some of the rendered outputs will create a scroll wheel next to it often when its displaying a matrix with fractional values inside. Theres nothing I can figure out to deal with this annoying issue.

3. When viewing in github some values show up as UnknownValue when they fail to render, this issue is fixed when opening the file in jupyter notebook or vscode.
